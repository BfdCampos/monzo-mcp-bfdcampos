# üè¶ Monzo MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to your Monzo banking data through a Claude tool.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BfdCampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos.git
cd monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos

# Install dependencies using uv (Python package manager)
uv install
```

## üîë API Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your Monzo credentials:

> [!NOTE]
> To get your credentials, follow the instructions in the [official Monzo Dev API Docs](https://docs.monzo.com/)

```
MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_access_token'
MONZO_USER_ID='your_user_id'
MONZO_ACCOUNT_ID='your_default_account_id'

# Add specific account IDs for different account types
MONZO_UK_PREPAID_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_prepaid_account_id'
MONZO_UK_RETAIL_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_personal_account_id'
MONZO_UK_MONZO_FLEX_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_flex_account_id'
MONZO_UK_REWARDS_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_rewards_account_id'
MONZO_UK_RETAIL_JOINT_JOINT_ACCOUNT_ID='your_joint_account_id'
```

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend getting the account IDs and adding them to your dotenv file to have a smoother experience with the server and reduce the number of API calls. This can also be found in the [official Monzo Dev API Docs](https://docs.monzo.com/).

## üîß Setup with Claude Desktop

### Method 1: Automatic Installation

Use the MCP CLI tool to install the server automatically:

```bash

```

### Method 2: Manual Configuration

Add the server to your Claude Desktop configuration file located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json

  "mcpServers": {
    "Monzo": {
      "command": "/Users/[Your Home Directory]/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",

      ]
    }
  }

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details><summary>My Claude Desktop is not detecting the server</summary>

- Ensure you have the latest version of Claude Desktop.
- Restart Claude Desktop by force quitting the app and reopening it.
- Make sure your path is correct in the configuration file.
- Use the absolute path to your `uv` installation, e.g., `/Users/[Your Home Directory]/.local/bin/uv` in the command section of the configuration file.
- Verify that the `requests` library is included in the `--with` argument list in your configuration, as this is a common cause of connection issues.

</details>

<details><summary>I've asked Claude about my balance but it's not using the MCP server</summary>

- LLMs like Claude may not always use the MCP server for every request. Try rephrasing your question, specifically asking Claude to check your Monzo balance using the Monzo MCP tool.
- You can check if there were any errors by looking at the logs in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-Monzo.log`.

</details>

<details><summary>How do pot deposits and withdrawals work?</summary>

- When you deposit money into a pot or withdraw from a pot, the MCP creates a unique dedupe_id that includes the "triggered_by" parameter.
- This helps identify transactions and prevents accidental duplicate transactions.
- The default "triggered_by" value is "mcp", but you can customise this to track different sources of pot transfers.

</details>

<details><summary>What is uv?</summary>

- `uv` is a Python package manager and installer that's designed to be much faster than pip.
- It maintains isolated environments for your projects and resolves dependencies efficiently.
- Learn more at [github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
