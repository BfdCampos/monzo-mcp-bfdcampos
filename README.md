## ‚ùì FAQ

<details><summary>My Claude Desktop is not detecting the server</summary>

- Ensure you have the latest version of Claude Desktop.
- Restart Claude Desktop by force quitting the app and reopening it.
- Make sure your path is correct in the configuration file.
- Use the absolute path to your `uv` installation, e.g., `/Users/[Your Home Directory]/.local/bin/uv` in the command section of the configuration file.
- Verify that the `requests` library is included in the `--with` argument list in your configuration, as this is a common cause of connection issues.

<details><summary>I've asked Claude about my balance but it's not using the MCP server</summary>

- LLMs like Claude may not always use the MCP server for every request. Try rephrasing your question, specifically asking Claude to check your Monzo balance using the Monzo MCP tool.
- You can check if there were any errors by looking at the logs in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-Monzo.log`.
